Ben will use natural language processing and machine learning to generate professional and effective content for you.

## How to use Ben

To use Ben, you need to install the slack app from [here](https://slack.com/apps/A01U8RZLZJQ-ben-the-ai-writing-assistant). Once you have installed the app, you can invite Ben to any channel or direct message by typing `/invite @Ben`. You can also start a conversation with Ben by typing `@Ben` in any channel or direct message.

To request Ben to write something for you, you need to follow this format:

`@Ben write [type of content] about [topic]`

For example:

`@Ben write a cold email about web design services`

`@Ben write an Instagram caption about my new book`

`@Ben write a summary of this article`

Ben will reply with a draft of the content and ask you if you want to edit or optimize it. You can reply with `yes` or `no`. If you reply with `yes`, Ben will ask you what you want to change or improve. You can give Ben specific instructions or feedback, such as:

`Make it more concise`

`Add a call to action`

`Use more emoticons`

`Fix the grammar`

Ben will then generate a new version of the content based on your input. You can repeat this process until you are satisfied with the result. If you reply with `no`, Ben will thank you for using his service and end the conversation.
